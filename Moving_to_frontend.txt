								React App for frontend->
-Action Planning for handling frontend:
			1)Much easier,less code
			2)Authentication is handled by django
			3)Admin pannel is handled by django.
			4)We just have to worry about the user signup,user purchase,as well as user cart.
			5)helpers will handle API calls
			6)User,Core and auth


-Config for backend connection and structure
			installation- npm install react-router-dom braintree-web-drop-in-react query-string  (connect it to the braintree,enabling the paypal)
			create a .env file in projfrontend
				-REACT_APP_BACKEND=http://localhost:8000/api/
			create a backend.js in src folder(Since we dont want to touch our environment variable again and again )
				-export const API = process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND;
			create auth,user,core folder in src 
					auth-
					create helper folder in auth folder and inside that create 
					
					index.js(Majority of the functionality of authentication will go inside index.js),
					PrivateRoutes.js files(In this we will be adding config from react router so that all the routes we want to be protected means no body withouthout authentication should be able to access them.)
			
					user-
					create a helper folder in auth and create userapicalls.js file in that folder

					userapicalls.js(All the calls related to the user information like purchase will go there not the authentication as sign up sign in )

					Create profile.js inside user folder not in helper folder
					Create signup.js 
					Create signin.js
					Create UserDashboard.js 

					Core-
					Create helper folder-In helper Folder-
								carthelper.js
								coreapicalls.js
								imagehelper.js
								orderhelper.js
								paymenthelper.js

					In Core folder
							Create Base.js
							Create Card.js
							Create Cart.js
							Create Home.js
							Create Menu.js
							Create PaymentB.js
